# Add KernelSU and Magisk Action

The ***Plus*** version, can compile kernel, AnyKernel3, boot-kernelsu.img, boot-magisk.img, magisk.zip

Compiling the Action of the Non-GKI kernel has a certain degree of universality.

## Support Kernels

- `4.19`
- `4.14`
- `4.9`

## Usage

> After the compilation is successful, a series of content such as AnyKernel3 will be uploaded in `Action`, and the device check has been closed. Please ensure that the phone is unlocked before flashing in!

- Star this repo, then fork this repo to make sure the workflow works fine.

- Edit the configuration according to config.env.xx-xx.simple (your language), then rename the configuration file to config_xxxx.env, ***must*** end with `.env`!
Then open [kernel-build.yml](.github/workflows/build-kernel.yml) and modify the configuration file name on line 32.

- Then enter Actions, click the option, you will see `Run workflows` on the top of the large dialog box on the right, click it to start the build.

- If Release is checked, Release will be released
